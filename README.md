## Load Time:
Page resulted loading time of **2sec-3.5sec** when used Google's Light house to generate report.

After optimising that gave a light house score time **1.8sec-2.4sec** scoring light house score of **`98`**.

**Steps I took to optimise this app:**
- Reduced image size to 90%.
- Used components for comman components.
- Used NextJs routing module for routers.
- Removed un-used modules.
